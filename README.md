# Custom Geospatial Web Application With Flask

The objective of this assignment is to build a web application that allows a user to browse a map and search for the closest coffee shops and gas stations. You will use the following technologies:
- Python Flask (web application framework)
- PostGIS (geospatial database)
- Leaflet (javascript library)

You will start by adding a simple serarch feature that fetches places from your `osm` database and prints them on a new page. You will then adapt the page to returning geospatial results asynchronously, build an auto-complete feature, and finally provide routing recommendations as part of a real-time dynamic geospatial application

## Background
### Python Flask
Flask is a web application framework written in python. It provides an easy and organized way to build dynamic websites. Read the Flask tutorial at https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/tutorial/ to get a feel for how it works. In this assignment the basic structure of a working Flask application is provided for you so all you need to do is expand in a few places to turn it into a geospatial processing application.

### AJAX and JQuery
In the early days of the web, webpages were generally loaded all at once and rendered one time. This was extremely limiting for interactive applications because every action required loading a whole new page. Javascript provides the interactivity needed to reload parts of the page by changing the document object model or loading content into memory. AJAX (an acronym of the poorly named "Asynchronous JavaScript And XML") allows javascript to send http requests using `XMLHttpRequest` in order to dynamically update an HTML document. There are various ways to use AJAX but the simplest is to use a an AJAX library like JQuery. 

[JQuery](https://jquery.com/) is a javascript library that allows you to update the HTML document based on the results of calls to remote urls. Read https://learn.jquery.com/about-jquery/how-jquery-works/ to understand more about what JQuery is and how it works.

## Assignment

Initially, this repo will have a working Flask application that serves an interactive map. The page will have a search box in which you can search for place names. Initially, this search will do nothing. It is your job to wire it up to query the OSM database you populated and search for placenames. 

The first objective for the student will be to add a search feature. This search feature will allow you to enter a place name and it will serarch the PostGIS database for matching results. To accomplish this the student will have to make two things:

- Add a form to the index.html page
- Create a `/search` route in the flask app that searches the database

### Create a `/search` route in Flask

At first we are going to make the `/search` endpoint populate results in an HTML page named `results.json`. Then, once we can see that it's working, we will wire it up to auto-complete using AJAX. 

Add the following `route` to your `app.py`:
```
@app.route("/search")
def search():
    place = request.args.get('term')
    
    # This adds a `%` to the end of the `place` parameter, allowing us to search for places that start with our search term.
    place = "{}{}".format(place,'%')
    
    # Get a Database connection to the OSM database
    conn = get_db_connection()

    # cursor() allows python code to execute SQL in the database
    cur = conn.cursor()
    
    # This is the actual query. You may want to work out the SQL statement in a separate `psql` or other datbase session.
    # The start SQL will give you everything matching `place` exactly which isn't quite what you need. 
    # See the instructions for guidance on how to update this for this jquery autocomplete
    sql = '''
SELECT 
  name as label, 
  name
FROM 
  import.osm_places 
WHERE 
  name = %s;
'''
    cur.execute(sql, [place])

    # For our pursposes we want to save the results in a special json format with two keys: `label` and `value`.
    # That's because jquery `autocomplete` will work if follow this format convention for our JSON output.

    results = []
    for row in cur.fetchall():
        results.append({'label': row[0], 'value': row[1]})
    cur.close()
    conn.close()

    # This converts our list of dicts into an HTML-friendly format for our http response
    template = jinja2.Template("""{{ matches | tojson(indent=2) }}""")
    return template.render(matches=results)

```
In order to use the `psycopg2` library to connect to the postgresql database, add the following to the file at line 2:

```
import psycopg2, os
```
This relies on a function we haven't created yet that actually creates the database connection. Add this function above the `route`s:
```
def get_db_connection():
    conn = psycopg2.connect(host='localhost',
                            database='hawaii',
                            user=os.environ['PGUSER'],
                            password=os.environ['PGPASSWORD'])
    return conn
```
You should recognize the parameters as those same parameters you used to connect to your `hawaii` database in previous assignments.

If you read the comments around the `search()` function above you'll see that the SQL is only semi-working. It is up to you to make it work with the JQuery autocomplete function. Specifically, the SQL function should do the following:
- match any place whose name _starts with_ the search `term` variable. You will need the `LIKE` operator and the wild card, `%`.
- matches places regardless of upper/lower case
- returns two columns:
  - column 1 will be used as a label which will contain the place `name` and its `type`.
    - you will want to use the `concat` operation [ref](https://www.postgresqltutorial.com/postgresql-string-functions/postgresql-concat-function/)
    - you may need to use an escape character (`\`) to escape single quotes. For example:
      - `sql = 'select concat(col1, \' - \', col2')` would concatenate columns `col1` and `col2` with the string `" - "` in between them.
  - column 2 will be the `osm_id` for the matching record. This will be used in a separate query to request additional information about the row for rendering on the map (e.g., the geometry).


### Tweak the SQL query

Open your PostgreSQL Explorer and work out the correct SQL to produce the following.  Your goal is to produce a SQL query that outputs results like the following, given a term like `honol`:

| Label             | Value      | 
| ----------------- | ---------- |
| Honolulu (city)   | 21442033   |
| Honolulu (county) | 3962058199 |

Once you get the SQL figured out, embed the SQL in your `/search` flask route (being sure to escape any single quotes). To test it out:

```
python3 app.py
```
and in another terminal window:
```
curl http://localhost:5000/search?term=honol
```
When it works the results will look like this:
```
[
  {
    "label": "Honolulu (city)",
    "value": 21442033
  },
  {
    "label": "Honolulu (county)",
    "value": 3962058199
  }
]
```

At this point you are ready to wire up autocompletion

#### Deliverable: `/search` screenshot
Once your `/search` is working, take a screenshot of the output of the curl command above and name it:
- `screencap-search.png`

### Setup JQuery with autocomplete
Open your `index.html` page. 

To enable the use of the JQuery javascript library, add the following to the `<head>` section:
```
    <!-- jQuery library -->
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.6.0/jquery.min.js"></script>

    <!-- jQuery UI library -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.13.2/themes/smoothness/jquery-ui.css">
    <script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jqueryui/1.13.2/jquery-ui.min.js"></script>
```
Next, to setup autocomplate, add this autocomplete script to the `<head>` section:
```
 <script>
    $( function() {
        $( "#place" ).autocomplete({
          source: "/search"
        });
    } );
</script>
```
According to the [JQuery docs](https://api.jqueryui.com/autocomplete/), the url `source` will be passed a `term` parameter with the search term for autocomplete. Our next step is to create a new endpoint in our Flask app to handle this request and perform the database query needed for autocomplete to work. A route is already created to `app.py` with the bones of an autocomplete.


When autocomplete works you should be able to type "Honol" and see the autocompletion dialog show up below the text box:

![media/autocomplete.png](media/autocomplete.png)


#### Deliverable: `/search` result screenshot
Once your `/search` is working, take a screenshot of the output of the index.html page with the autocomplete drop-down
- `screencap-result.png`

### Make the autocomplete clickable
We want the autocomplete results to be clickable so that when you click on a result it adds a Leaflet marker on the map and zooms to it. This will replace the JQuery function in `index.html` for autocompletion:

```
  // setup places search autocomplete
  $( function() {
    // declare marker outside `autocomplete()` so it can easily be removed later 
    // for example, when something else is selected.
    var marker

    $( "#place" ).autocomplete({
      source: "/search",

      select: function( event, ui ) {
          event.preventDefault();

            var lat = ui.item.lat; // this needs to be part of the `/search` response
            var lon = ui.item.lon; // this needs to be part of the `/search` response

            // if the marker is not null it means we already have one that should be removed before we add another one
            if (marker != null) {
              map.removeLayer(marker)
            }
            marker = L.marker([lat, lon],{title: ui.item.label, icon: redIcon}).addTo(map);
            
            marker.bindPopup('<b>'+ui.item.label+'</b>').openPopup();

            // Add a button to find coffee. This button should be bound with an `onclick` action that calls a
            // javascript `findCoffee()` function that takes a longitude and latitude argument
            $( "#search") .html('<input type="button" value="Find coffee!" onclick="findCoffee('+marker.getLatLng().lng+','+marker.getLatLng().lat+')">');

            map.flyTo([lat, lon], 14);
            return false;
      }
    });
  } );
```
Note that the above requires the `/search` result to return additional information beside the `label` and `name`. Specifically, it needs to return two arguments named `lon` and `lat`. You will need to modify the SQL to return two additional columns. You will want to look into the PostGIS functions [`ST_X()`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_X.html) and [`ST_Y()`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Y.html). Note also that the default projection for your OSM data is `EPSG:3857` which is _not_ lat/long so you will need to use the [`ST_Transform()`](https://postgis.net/docs/ST_Transform.html) function as well. The SRID you want is `4326`.

You will find yourself starting and stopping the `flask app.py` in order to test this.

When you do get the clickable autocomplete working you should be able to click on a result and have the map fly to a new red marker for that location. 

#### Deliverable: `/search` marker screenshot
Once your `/search` is working, take a screenshot of the map showing the marker placed when you clicked the search result:
- `screencap-marker.png`

### Create a `/find_coffee` route in Flask
Once you can zoom to a search result we want to add a new feature that allows you to search the `amenities` table for nearby cafes. We will create a new `route` called `/find_coffee` that finds the 5 closest `amenities` records to the location provided (i.e., the geo-location of the place you find from `/search` result). 

The PostGIS is based on [this k-nearest neighbors example](https://postgis.net/workshops/postgis-intro/knn.html). However, instead of using a static point with WKT we will create a new point from the search result's `lon` and `lat`:
```

@app.route("/find_coffee")
def find_coffee():
    lon = request.args.get('lon')
    lat = request.args.get('lat')

    conn = get_db_connection()
    cur = conn.cursor()
    ewkt = "SRID=4326;POINT("+lon+" "+lat+")"
    print(ewkt)
    sql = '''
SELECT 
  a.geometry <-> ST_Transform(%s::geometry,3857) AS dist, 
  osm_id, 
  name,
  ST_Y(ST_Transform(ST_Centroid(a.geometry), 4326)) AS lat,
  ST_X(ST_Transform(ST_Centroid(a.geometry), 4326)) AS lon
FROM
  import.osm_amenities a
WHERE
  type='cafe'
ORDER BY
  dist
LIMIT 5;
'''
    cur.execute(sql, [ewkt])

    results = []
    for row in cur.fetchall():
        results.append({'dist': row[0], 'osm_id': row[1], 'name': row[2], 'lat': row[3], 'lon': row[4]})
    cur.close()
    conn.close()
    template = jinja2.Template("""{{ matches | tojson(indent=2) }}""")
    return template.render(matches=results)
```
The query for `lat` and `lon` are a little complicated so let's break it down here:
```
  ST_Y(ST_Transform(ST_Centroid(a.geometry), 4326)) AS lat,
```

The function to return the Y-coordinate (latitude) is `ST_X`. But we want the coordinate in WGS84, which is SRID `4326` so we need to call `ST_Transform()` on the geometry or else the units will be in meters. However, this fails for some records because the `amenities` tables contains multipoints, lines, multilines, polygons, and multi-polygons and `ST_X()` will not return a single value for those cases. So we will take the centroid to ensure that there is just one `x` and `y` coordinate for each input geometry. 

That route ensures that calls to `http://localhost:5000/find_coffee?lon=-157.9&lat=21.3` (or similar) will return a response like this:
```
[
  {
    "dist": 552.943677956968,
    "lat": 21.3026504599764,
    "lon": -157.860207002981,
    "name": "NIO Snow Ice \u0026 Tea",
    "osm_id": 7675621188
  },
  {
    "dist": 590.892286578368,
    "lat": 21.3006833949397,
    "lon": -157.858989531545,
    "name": "Up Roll Caf\u00e9 Honolulu",
    "osm_id": 5010476325
  },
  {
    "dist": 710.589057675542,
    "lat": 21.298639886946,
    "lon": -157.856416706366,
    "name": "Cafe Villamor",
    "osm_id": 9828508517
  },
  {
    "dist": 763.631317846278,
    "lat": 21.307929131138,
    "lon": -157.861496558784,
    "name": "Cafe Central",
    "osm_id": 2903614201
  },
  {
    "dist": 807.540902546282,
    "lat": 21.2983416588311,
    "lon": -157.852801256251,
    "name": "Mr. Tea",
    "osm_id": 10764748472
  }
]
```

#### Deliverable: `/find_coffee` curl screenshot
Once your `/find_coffee` is working, take a screenshot of the curl command showing the output of 
```
curl http://localhost:5000/find_coffee?lon=-157.9&lat=21.3
```
Name it: 
- `screencap-find-coffee.png`

Our next task will be to update `index.html` to use the information in this response to add new markers to the map containing the closest cafes to our search location.

### Add closest cafes
In `index.html` there is a stubbed function for `find_coffee()`. Update its content to looks like this:
```
  // search for coffee shops near a point
  function findCoffee(lon, lat) {
    $.ajax({url: "/find_coffee?lon="+lon+"&lat="+lat, success: function(result){
      clearResults();
      let i = 0;
      jsonResult = JSON.parse(result)
      while (i < jsonResult.length) {
        marker = L.marker([jsonResult[i]["lat"], jsonResult[i]["lon"]], {title: jsonResult[i]["name"]}).addTo(map);
        coffeeMarkers.push(marker);
        marker.bindPopup('<i>'+jsonResult[i]["name"]+'</i>').openPopup();
        i++;
      }
    }});
    $ ( "#hide_results" ).show();
  }
```

This function, which is called when the user clicks on the `find coffee` button, will call out to the `/find_coffee` API endpoint and, with a successful result (containing the closest cafes), iterate over each of the records in the result and add a marker to the page. Note however that markers would be added every time we run this function so a call to `clearResults()` (which removes all the markers) preceeds adding markers to the table. This is what `clearResults()` looks like:

```
  // remove coffee shops from map
  function clearResults() {
    while (coffeeMarkers.length > 0) {            
      map.removeLayer(coffeeMarkers.pop())
      $ ( "#hide_results" ).hide();
    }
  }
```


#### Deliverable: `/find_coffee` map screenshot
Once your `/find_coffee` is working on the map, take a screenshot of the map with cafe markers on it
- `screencap-find-coffee-map.png`

We're almost done. We want to allow the user to move the search location in case the marker isn't exactly where we want.

### Make the search result draggable
Make the search result marker draggable in the `#place` autocomplete section by adding `draggable: true` to this line:
```
  marker = L.marker([lat, lon],{title: ui.item.label, icon: redIcon}).addTo(map);
```                  
like this:
```
  marker = L.marker([lat, lon],{title: ui.item.label, draggable: true, icon: redIcon}).addTo(map);
```
Addtionally, we want the `findCoffee()` function to be called with different coordinates if we move the marker so we can update that button on the `dragend` event for that marker:
```
  marker.on('dragend', function(event){
    var marker = event.target;
    var position = marker.getLatLng();
    marker.setLatLng(new L.LatLng(position.lat, position.lng),{draggable:'true'});
    map.panTo(new L.LatLng(position.lat, position.lng))
    $( "#search") .html('<input type="button" value="Find coffee!" onclick="findCoffee('+marker.getLatLng().lng+','+marker.getLatLng().lat+')">');
  });
```

#### Deliverable: `/find_coffee` draggable marker 
Once your `/find_coffee` is working on the map, take a screenshot of the map with cafe markers on it after searching a second time but after dragging the original (red) place marker to another location
- `screencap-find-coffee-dragged.png`

## Conclusion
By this time you should have a python flask web application with three endpoints: `/index`, `/search`, and `/find_coffee` that provide back-end spport for a `static/index.html` page that embeds a map. The page has a testbox that allows a user to search the OSM database for places matching a name and the results are clickable, making it a simple click to search for the closest cafes to the place just searched. Along the way you should have made the following screenshots:
- `screencap-search.png`
- `screencap-result.png`
- `screencap-marker.png`
- `screencap-find-coffee.png`
- `screencap-find-coffee-map.png`
- `screencap-find-coffee-dragged.png`
